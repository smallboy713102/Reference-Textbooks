# # Week 3: Transfer Learning
# 
# Welcome to this assignment! This week, you are going to use a technique called `Transfer Learning` in which you utilize an already trained network to help you solve a similar problem to the one it was originally trained to solve.
# 
# Let's get started!

# In[ ]:


import os
import zipfile
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers
from tensorflow.keras import Model
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import RMSprop
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import img_to_array, load_img


# ## Dataset
# 
# For this assignment, you will use the `Horse or Human dataset`, which contains images of horses and humans. 
# 
# Download the `training` and `validation` sets by running the cell below:

# In[ ]:


# Get the Horse or Human training dataset
get_ipython().system('wget -q -P /content/ https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow-1-public/course2/week3/horse-or-human.zip')

# Get the Horse or Human validation dataset
get_ipython().system('wget -q -P /content/ https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow-1-public/course2/week3/validation-horse-or-human.zip')

test_local_zip = './horse-or-human.zip'
zip_ref = zipfile.ZipFile(test_local_zip, 'r')
zip_ref.extractall('/tmp/training')

val_local_zip = './validation-horse-or-human.zip'
zip_ref = zipfile.ZipFile(val_local_zip, 'r')
zip_ref.extractall('/tmp/validation')

zip_ref.close()


# This dataset already has an structure that is compatible with Keras' `flow_from_directory` so you don't need to move the images into subdirectories as you did in the previous assignments. However, it is still a good idea to save the paths of the images so you can use them later on:

# In[ ]:


# Define the training and validation base directories
train_dir = '/tmp/training'
validation_dir = '/tmp/validation'

# Directory with training horse pictures
train_horses_dir = os.path.join(train_dir, 'horses')
# Directory with training humans pictures
train_humans_dir = os.path.join(train_dir, 'humans')
# Directory with validation horse pictures
validation_horses_dir = os.path.join(validation_dir, 'horses')
# Directory with validation human pictures
validation_humans_dir = os.path.join(validation_dir, 'humans')

# Check the number of images for each class and set
print(f"There are {len(os.listdir(train_horses_dir))} images of horses for training.\n")
print(f"There are {len(os.listdir(train_humans_dir))} images of humans for training.\n")
print(f"There are {len(os.listdir(validation_horses_dir))} images of horses for validation.\n")
print(f"There are {len(os.listdir(validation_humans_dir))} images of humans for validation.\n")


# Now take a look at a sample image of each one of the classes:

# In[ ]:


print("Sample horse image:")
plt.imshow(load_img(f"{os.path.join(train_horses_dir, os.listdir(train_horses_dir)[0])}"))
plt.show()

print("\nSample human image:")
plt.imshow(load_img(f"{os.path.join(train_humans_dir, os.listdir(train_humans_dir)[0])}"))
plt.show()


# `matplotlib` makes it easy to see that these images have a resolution of 300x300 and are colored, but you can double check this by using the code below:

# In[ ]:


# Load the first example of a horse
sample_image  = load_img(f"{os.path.join(train_horses_dir, os.listdir(train_horses_dir)[0])}")

# Convert the image into its numpy array representation
sample_array = img_to_array(sample_image)

print(f"Each image has shape: {sample_array.shape}")


# As expected, the sample image has a resolution of 300x300 and the last dimension is used for each one of the RGB channels to represent color.

# ## Training and Validation Generators
# 
# Now that you know the images you are dealing with, it is time for you to code the generators that will fed these images to your Network. For this, complete the `train_val_generators` function below:
# 
# **Important Note:** The images have a resolution of 300x300 but the `flow_from_directory` method you will use allows you to set a target resolution. In this case, **set a `target_size` of (150, 150)**. This will heavily lower the number of trainable parameters in your final network, yielding much quicker training times without compromising the accuracy!

# ## Pipelining the pre-trained model with your own
# 
# Now that the pre-trained model is ready, you need to "glue" it to your own model to solve the task at hand.
# 
# For this you will need the last output of the pre-trained model, since this will be the input for your own. Complete the `output_of_last_layer` function below.

# Now you will create the final model by adding some additional layers on top of the pre-trained model.

# Complete the `create_final_model` function below. You will need to use Tensorflow's [Functional API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/functional) for this since the pretrained model has been created using it.

# Wow, that is a lot of parameters!
# 
# After submitting your assignment later, try re-running this notebook but use the original resolution of 300x300, you will be surprised to see how many more parameters are for that case.
# 
# Now train the model:

# In[ ]:


# Run this and see how many epochs it should take before the callback
# fires, and stops training at 99.9% accuracy
# (It should take a few epochs)
callbacks = myCallback()

                    callbacks=callbacks)


# The training should have stopped after less than 10 epochs and it should have reached an accuracy over 99,9% (firing the callback). This happened so quickly because of the pre-trained model you used, which already contained information to classify humans from horses. Really cool!

# You will need to submit this notebook for grading. To download it, click on the `File` tab in the upper left corner of the screen then click on `Download` -> `Download .ipynb`. You can name it anything you want as long as it is a valid `.ipynb` (jupyter notebook) file.

# **Congratulations on finishing this week's assignment!**
# 
# You have successfully implemented a convolutional neural network that leverages a pre-trained network to help you solve the problem of classifying humans from horses.
# 
# **Keep it up!**
